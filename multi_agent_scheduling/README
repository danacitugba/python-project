Recent scheduling studies focus on variable job-processing times and multi-agent problems simultaneously, but none of them studied with jobs under the simultaneous effect of learning and deterioration. In makale1.py,  it is studied for a two-competing-agent single-machine scheduling problem with jobs under simultaneous learning and deterioration effect. The goal is to find an optimal solution to minimize the total weighted completion time for the first agent, subject to the restriction that no tardy job is allowed for the second agent. For this problem, a two-stage methodology is developed in the study. In the first stage, heuristics are proposed to find the near-optimal solution of which is used as input for the second stage. For the second stage, a branch-and-bound algorithm along with several dominances and a lower bound is developed to find the optimal solution.
